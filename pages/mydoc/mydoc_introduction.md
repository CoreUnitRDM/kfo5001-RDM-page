## Introduction to KFO5001-Resolve PAIN

Chronic pain is a significant global health problem, and understanding recovery mechanisms is essential for better prevention and treatment. The Clinical Research Unit “Peripheral mechanisms of pain and their resolution” (KFO5001 ResolvePAIN) was established to study why some patients recover from pain while others do not. By integrating clinical, preclinical, and basic sciences, the unit aims to uncover peripheral and systemic processes involved in pain persistence or resolution, along with their CNS control. Our research involving pain patients, animal models, and cellular systems has identified crucial factors for pain resolution. These include specific potassium channel subtypes that affect neuronal excitability, essential barrier proteins, the NGF-IL-7 axis, and sex-specific regulation of macrophage migration to the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Additionally, resolution-related genes from Drosophila and human genes involved in pain resolution were identified through the exploratory projects Resolve2.0. Core units for standardizing blood and skin analyses and MR neurography for DRG imaging have been established, facilitating the study of differential effects in pain persistence and resolution.
